They can be easily hidden on smaller viewports, as shown below, with optional display utilities. We hide them initially with .d-none and bring them back on medium-sized devices with .d-md-block. If your content is not visible enough, you can cover the image with a darker mask. You can easily change the intensity and color of the mask. To learn more read our MASKS documentation.
